# Maze

## Intro
This is a python project to create and solve a maze with various algorithms  
These project contains two modules:  
`MazeGenerator.py` contains maze generation algorithms, while  
`MazeSolver.py` contains maze solving algorithms  

## Dependencies
`matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `random`

## How to Use
`MazeGenerator.py` can be directly imported. Every algorithm will return a 2-d array storing the information of the maze generated.  
`MazeSolver.py` is best used along with `MazeGenerator.py`. The return value from maze generation algorithms can be used as the parameter `data`.
